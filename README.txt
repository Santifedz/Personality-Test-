Hello Udemy team! 

I am very pleased to present you my Personality test project. I completed this project for my data structures and algorithms course. As I read the Internship job posting and saw the GitHub challenge this project instantly came to mind, It is a "test" program that extracts questions from a database file then prompts them to the user. Using the users answers, it compiles a "OCEAN" (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism) then it compares the user to a set of "characters" and finds the one the user is most similar to.

If you would like to view some of my other projects please feel free to check out my GitHub:

This program works on the command terminal once you are in the same directory as the files. 
To run this program simply type the following in terminal: 
make build
make run 

Thank you so much for taking the time to view my program. 
-Santiago Fernandez
